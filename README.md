# sat-defi
In view of the global trend of decentralized finance, SAS project side has invested heavily in developing a complete defi ecological token sat: it plays a role in decentralized exchange, payment, mortgage, loan, insurance and data services launched on the future platform.

Sat issued 3.2 million pieces of constant volume, totally decentralized, open source, distributed bookkeeping of blockchain, 10% for ecological construction and 90% for community sermon mining.

So what are the rules of community sermon mining?

First, we need to purchase SAS with a value of at least 100u for node pledge, with a pledge time of 365 days, which is equivalent to one year of Tun coin. Some people say that the pledge has been so long, SAS has risen 10 times better, what if it falls? The SAT token of three times of platform LP is in the block mine pool, and three tools are given to dig out the triple sat as soon as possible. If you make triple back soon, it doesn't matter if SAS rises and falls in a year. If you dig up the triple block pool, the SAS pledged by the node will not be available. After one year of node pledge expires, the original currency of the block mine pool that has not been dug is returned, which is very reasonable.

Three tools for mining you can dig out three times of assets from the block pool as early as possible. The first tool is "flow mining":

You can see it as a current mine. Current pledge with in and out, up to 10 times

Leverage, the calculation force starts from 0.4%, the calculation force increases by 0.1% every 20 days, and the maximum increase is 1.6%. The SAT produced every day is realized at any time. If the current pledge is transferred out during the period, the calculation force will be returned to 0.4%. For example, your node pledges 10000, and the current pledge is 100000 at the highest. The result of mining in the previous 20 days is 100000 x0.4% X20 days = 8000. That is, you have returned 10000 of the node pledge in more than one month, and the current pledge will be in and out. Every player comes to this platform to make contributions. The mobile mining is not playing. When the mobile pledge is transferred out, 3% of gas is used to destroy SAS, which produces value from scarcity. The rest 97% of the original currency returns. Although it seems you're 3 percent less, SAS destruction is growing and prices may be up 3 percent or more.

The second tool is [contract mining]:

The contract pledge is divided into one month to six months contract, with the calculation force of 0.6% - 1.6% per day. The maximum benefit must be 1.6% of the contract with 6 months. Assuming that the node pledged the SAS with a value of 10000 yuan, the block mine pool will have a sat of 30000 yuan.

The current pledge + contract pledge is less than 25 times, assuming that the current pledge is 0, the maximum contract pledge can be 25 times. After the expiration of the contract pledge, 3% of gas cost will be deducted from the destruction, and the scarcity will generate value, and the rest 97% of the original currency will be returned.

The third tool is [link mining]:

If we link one 3 5 7 9 nodes, we can get one node generation, two node generation, 3-5 node generation, 6-10 node generation, 11-20 nodes for them mobile mining + 20%, 10%, 5%, 3% and 2% of the contract mining for them, so as to accelerate the release of three times of block mine pool output. The advantages are summarized as follows:

First: single chain profit, as long as we link a very powerful player, the other 8 nodes make up their own orders, take 20 node generation, solve the problem that elephant legs do not make money in the past.

Second: resource sharing, because each player has only two linked nodes, but all want to take 20 node generation, all of which need to link 9 nodes, which means that there are seven nodes on average to slide down and help each other.

Third: the purchase price is strong, and the calculation force will not be generated after the mining pool of 3 times block is completed. We need to repeatedly pledge nodes. If 10000 nodes are pledged at a time, 30000 will be charged in the block mine pool. After the 30000 excavation, we will pledge 10000 nodes, and the block mine pool will have 30000 sat value. Because we keep buying SAS pledge, this purchase is very strong, which forms an ecological cycle of buying and selling.

As the player of evangelism powder absorption, we can start the business only by 400u: node pledge ≥ 100u, current pledge + contract pledge ≥ 300u are qualified nodes and effective links.

The fourth reward: node upgrade calculation

There are six levels: first, look at D1 level. As long as the cumulative performance of SAS node pledge of small chain is 30000 u, it can become D1. If there is a player in the small chain as the market, today node pledges 100u, the market will accelerate the release of 300u of the block mine pool tomorrow, and he will need to pledge at least 100u or more in the future, so that it will be down in 30 days, He has pledged at least 30 times each node pledge 100u, which means the cumulative performance of 3000u node pledge. In total, 10 small partners will meet the requirements, and the performance requirements are very low.

There is a D1 (sliding) for the chain. You are D2. If you have a D2 for each chain, you are D3, and so on. D5 to D1 can get 10%, 8%, 6%, 4% and 2% of the total contract calculation power of their own network flow + contract. If you reach D5, the chain will definitely reach D4, they take 8 percent, and you'll take the 2 percent difference.

If you are promoted to super node, even the chain is promoted to super node, and you can still get 2% of the performance of the small chain after you are at the same level as the market. The award is 2000 u, 4000 u, 8000 u, 12000u, 16000 u and 20000 U / day peak.

Sat ecological defi advantages: chain assets, open and transparent, intelligent contracts, trust free, automatic execution, no one for interference, large volume, globalization.
